# Rhea's Journal

## Week 1

### November 8

Today, I pushed starter code for our project, copied from Labs 6 and 7, to make setting up the object models and Cybersource Payment Gateway simpler later on. I also created some bare-bone templates for our front end pages, particularly the home, registration, and login pages. Right now they do not have any functionality, but they are ready to be expanded on.
