# Rhea's Journal

## Week 1

### November 8

Today, I pushed starter code for our project, copied from Labs 6 and 7, to make setting up the object models and Cybersource Payment Gateway simpler later on. I also created some bare-bone templates for our front end pages, particularly the home, registration, and login pages. Right now they do not have any functionality, but they are ready to be expanded on.

### November 20

I have created my own branch to do some test implementation. Currently my team and I are trying to decide whether to split our source code into 3 folders or 1, and I am testing whether implementing in one folder is feasible.

(later)

I have also implemented the registration & login backend. Now users can create an account and login.

## Week 3

### November 24

In my own branch, I separated the html templates into their own frontend folder, and edited the docker-compose.yaml files so that I can deploy the frontend and my own spring-users microservice on separate ports. I also added REST API calls for the frontend to communicate with the backend. I now have the frontend and the login/registration backend running on separate ports, and able to communicate.
